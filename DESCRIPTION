Title: A package to learn data science. While model creation consumes around 10% of almost any predictive modeling project; funModeling will try to cover remaining 90%: data preparation, profiling, selecting best variables (dataviz), assessing model performance and other functions; either with functions to common problems and the explanation of how to interpret their results.

# funModeling quick-start {#quick_start}

This package contains a set of functions related to exploratory data analysis, data preparation and model performance. It is used by people coming from business, research and teaching (profesors and students).

`funModeling` is intimately related to the _Data Science Live Book_ -Open Source- (2017), in the sense that most of its functionality is used to to explain different topics addressed by the book.

## Opening the black-box 

Some functions have in-line comments so the user can open the black-box and learn how it was developed, tune or improve any of them. 

All the functions are well documented, explaining all the parameters as well as containing short examples. R documentation can be accessed by: `help("name_of_the_function")`.

This quick-start is focused only on the functions, all explanations around them, the how and when use them, can accessed following the "_**read more here.**_" link below each section.

## Exploratory data analysis

### `df_status`: dataset health status

Use case: analyze the zeros, missing values (`NA`), infinity, data type and number of unique values for a given dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(funModeling)

df_status(heart_disease)
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/exploratory-data-analysis.html#dataset-health-status)

<br>


### `plot_num`: Plotting distributions for numerical variables.

It plots only numerical variables. 

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
plot_num(heart_disease)
```

Notes:

* `bins`: Sets the number of bins. 10 by default.
* `path_out` indicates the path directory, if it has a value the plot is exported in jpeg.

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/exploratory-data-analysis.html#plotting-numerical-variable)


<br>

### `profiling_num`: Calculating several statistics for numerical variables. 

Retrieves several statistics for numerical variables.

```{r}
profiling_num(heart_disease)
```

Note: 

* `plot_num` and `profiling_num` automatically exclude non-numeric variables

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/exploratory-data-analysis.html#numerical-profiling-in-r)

<br>

### `freq`: Getting frequency distribution for categoric variable 

```{r distribution_categorical_variable, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# select only two variables for this example
heart_disease_2=heart_disease %>% select(chest_pain, thal)

# frequency distribution
freq(heart_disease_2)
```


Notes: 

* `freq` only processes `factor` and `character`, excluding non-categorical variables. 
* It returns the distribution table as a data frame.
* If `input` is empty, then it runs for all categorical variables.
* `path_out` indicates the path directory, if it has a value the plot is exported in jpeg.
* `na.rm` indicates if `NA` values should be excluded, `FALSE` by default.

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/exploratory-data-analysis.html#profiling-categorical-variables)


<br>

## Correlation

### `correlation_table`: Calculates R statistic

It retrieves R metric (or Pearson coefficient) for all numeric variables skipping the categorical ones. 

```{r}
correlation_table(heart_disease, "has_heart_disease")
```

Notes: 

* Only numeric variables are analyzed. Target variable must be numeric.
* If target is categorical, then it will be converted to numeric.

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/exploratory-data-analysis.html#linear-correlation)


<br>

### `var_rank_info`: Correlation based on information theory

Calculates correlation based on several information theory metrics between all variables in a data frame and a target variable.

```{r}
var_rank_info(heart_disease, "has_heart_disease")
```

Note: It analyzes numerical and categorical variables. Also used with a numerical discretization method before, just as `discretize_df`.


`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/selecting-best-variables.html#select_features_var_rank_info)



<br>

### `cross_plot`: Distribution plot between input and target variable

Retrieves the relative and absolute distribution between an input and target variable. 
Useful to explain and report if a variable is important or not.

```{r profiling_variable_predictive_modeling, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
cross_plot(data=heart_disease, input=c("age", "oldpeak"), target="has_heart_disease")
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/selecting-best-variables.html#profiling_target_cross_plot)

Notes: 

* `auto_binning`: `TRUE` by default, shows the numerical variable as categorical.
* `path_out` indicates the path directory, if it has a value the plot is exported in jpeg.
* `input` can be numeric or categoric, and `target` must be binary (two-class) variable
* If `input` is empty, then it runs for all variables.

<br>

### `plotar`: Boxplot and Density histogram between input and target variable

Useful to explain and report if a variable is important or not. 

**Boxplot:**

```{r boxplot_analysis, fig.height=2, fig.width=4}
plotar(data=heart_disease, input = c("age", "oldpeak"), target="has_heart_disease", plot_type="boxplot")
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/selecting-best-variables.html#target-profiling-using-boxplots)

<br>

**Density histograms:**

```{r density_histogram, fig.height=2, fig.width=4}
plotar(data=mtcars, input = "gear", target="cyl", plot_type="histdens")
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/selecting-best-variables.html#target-profiling-using-density-histograms)

Notes:

* `path_out` indicates the path directory, if it has a value the plot is exported in jpeg.
* If `input` is empty, then it runs for all numeric variables (skipping the categorical).
* `input` must be numeric, and target must be categoric.
* `target` can be multi-class (not only binary).

<br>

### `categ_analysis`: Quantitative analysis for binary outcome

Profile a binary target based on a categorical input variable, the representativness (`perc_rows`) and the accuracy (`perc_target`) for each value of the input variable. For example, the rate of having flu per country. 

```{r}
df_ca=categ_analysis(data = data_country, input = "country", target = "has_flu")

head(df_ca)
```
    
Note: 

* `input` variable must be categorical.
* `target` variable must be binary (two-value).

This function is used to analyze data when we need to reduce variable cardinality in predictive modeling.

## Data preparation

### Data discretization

#### `discretize_get_bins` + `discretize_df`: Convert numeric variables into categoric

We need two functions: `discretize_get_bins` which returns the thresholds for each variable, and then `discretize_df` which takes the result from the first function and converts the desiered variables. The binning criteria is equal frequency.

Example converting only two variables from a dataset.

```{r}
# Step 1: Getting the thresholds for the desiered variables: "max_heart_rate" and "oldpeak"
d_bins=discretize_get_bins(data=heart_disease, input=c("max_heart_rate", "oldpeak"), n_bins=5)

# Step 2: Applying the threshold to get final processed data frame
heart_disease_discretized=discretize_df(data=heart_disease, data_bins=d_bins, stringsAsFactors=T)
```

Following image will illustrate how the result is, please note that variable name will remaing the same.

![data discretization](data_discretization_1.png)


Notes: 

* This two-step procedure is tought to be used in production with new data.
* Min and max values for each bin will be `-Inf` and `Inf` respectevely.
* A fix in latest `funModeling` release (1.6.7) may have change the output in certain scenarios. Please check the results if you were using version 1.6.6.

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/data-preparation.html#data-discretization)


<br>

### `convert_df_to_categoric`: Convert every column in a data frame to character

Binning, or discretization criteria for any numerical variable is equal frequency. Factor variables are directly converted to character.

```{r}
iris_char=convert_df_to_categoric(data = iris, n_bins = 5)

# checking
head(iris_char)
```


### `equal_freq`: Convert numeric variable into categoric

Converts numeric vector into a factor using equal frequency criteria.

```{r}
new_age=equal_freq(heart_disease$age, n_bins = 5)

# checking results
Hmisc::describe(new_age)
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/data-preparation.html#equal-frequency-binning)

Notes:

* Altough `discretize_get_bins`, this functions doesn't insert `-Inf` and `Inf` as tthe extremes.

<br>

### `range01`: scales variable into 0 to 1 range 

Convert a numeric vector into the 0 to 1 range. Having 0 as the minimum and 1 as the maximum.

```{r}
age_scaled=range01(heart_disease$oldpeak)

# checking results
summary(age_scaled)
```

<br>

## Outliers Data Preparation

### `hampel_outlier` and  `tukey_outlier`: Gets outliers threshold

Both functions retrieves a two-value vector indicating the thresholds for which the values are considered as outliers.

**Using Tukey's method:**

```{r}
tukey_outlier(heart_disease$resting_blood_pressure)
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/data-preparation.html#detecting-outliers-using-tukey-method)

<br>

**Using Hampel's method:**

```{r}
hampel_outlier(heart_disease$resting_blood_pressure)
```

`r emo::ji("mag_right")` [**Read more here.**](https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/data-preparation.html#detecting-outliers-using-hampel-method)

Note: `tukey_outlier` and `hampel_outlier` are used internally in `prep_outliers`.

<br>

### `prep_outliers`: Prepare outliers in a data frame

It takes a data frame, and returns the same data frame plus the transformations specified in the `input` parameter. It also works with a single vector.


```{r}
# Get threshold according to Hampel's method
hampel_outlier(heart_disease$max_heart_rate)

# Apply function to stop outliers at the threshold values
data_prep=prep_outliers(data = heart_disease, input = c('max_heart_rate','resting_blood_pressure'), method = "hampel", type='stop')

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Get threshold according to Hampel's method
hampel_outlier(heart_disease$max_heart_rate)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Checking max and min value for 'max_heart_rate' before the transformation
sprintf("Before transformation -> Min: %s; Max: %s", min(heart_disease$max_heart_rate), max(heart_disease$max_heart_rate))

# Apply function to stop outliers at the threshold values
data_prep=prep_outliers(data = heart_disease, input = c('max_heart_rate','resting_blood_pressure'), method = "hampel", type='stop')

# Check the results, the maximum value is now 174.5 (the minimum remains the same).
# Checking max and min value for 'max_heart_rate' before the transformation
sprintf("After transformation -> Min: %s; Max: %s", min(data_prep$max_heart_rate), max(data_prep$max_heart_rate))

```

The maximum value is now 174.5 (the minimum remains the same).

Notes:

* `method` can be: `bottom_top`, `tukey` or `hampel`.
* `type` can be: `stop` or `set_na`. If `stop` all values flagged as outliers will be set to the threshold. If `set_na` the flagged values will set to `NA`.

## Predictive model performance

### `gain_lift`: Gain and lift performance curve

After computing the scores or probabilities for the class we want to predict, we pass it to `gain_lift` function. It returns a data frame with performance metrics.

```{r predictive_model_performance, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
# Crate machine learning model and getting its scores for positive case 
fit_glm=glm(has_heart_disease ~ age + oldpeak, data=heart_disease, family = binomial)
heart_disease$score=predict(fit_glm, newdata=heart_disease, type='response')

# Calculate performance metrics
gain_lift(data=heart_disease, score='score', target='has_heart_disease')

```
